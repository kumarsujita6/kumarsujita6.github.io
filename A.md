# The Bitter Reality
Hello guys, I am here with my 1st ever article for all of you.

First of all let me introduce myself, I am sujit kumar mishra a simple guy like all of you ,still studying in college. I think this is enough now lets start our todya's topic 'The bitter reality of life '

There are some Harsh realities of life let you know all about that.

## A lot of people dream of having your life 
You might not like the life you are living now. But, you are a blessed one, and you should probably be happy about it.
You are living in your comfort zone, having an active internet connection, food to eat, TV to watch and a roof to sleep under.
Do remember that even if you have only these four basic amenities, you are richer than 75% of the world’s population. Be happy for what you, but don’t settle for it.
The world is progressing rapidly, and you’ll be left behind if you are entirely content with what you’ve got now.
Make sure you know how to draw a line between being greedy and ascetic.

## More Friends Does Not Necessarily Mean MORE FUN
There is a misconception among people that higher the number of friends you’ve, more fun you’ll have.
The fact is the lesser friends you have, the lesser you have to deal with shits. Trust me; it doesn’t matter how many friends you have, all that matters is how many friends you can count upon when you are in need.
For me, having a single best friend is better than having ten random friends who aren’t going to be with you for long. 
Most importantly, understand the fact that a friend to all is a friend to none.

## Friends are not always reliable
Of course, friends are like the life jackets in a leaking ship. But, they aren’t always countable. If you have got some superb friends, they will surely try to help you whenever, and in whatever way they can, however, they won’t always be able to lend a hand.
Some life moments are made to be faced alone. You cannot expect anyone to come and join you in some of those hard time; it is just the way life works.
Those are the times when you realize how life works, and who are your trustable contacts.
Even though we never wish that you go through such times, but if you do, make sure that you do not lose hope and just go on the journey.

## Expectations always hurt
Expectations hurt, Period. Life was meant to be lived freely not with full of unrealistic expectations.( I swore you the more u expect the more u will b hurt if the things are not worked as u expect)
If you desire/expect something, make sure that you work hard enough to turn that into a reality sooner or later all by yourself.
Never expect anything out of someone.
You can expect things from only one person, on the whole, earth, and it is – YOU!

## You cannot make everyone happy
Whatever you do, wherever you go, there will always be someone who will be unhappy with you. They might have a valid reason for it or might not, but its not something that you should care about.
Learn to accept that you cannot make everyone like you, just be yourself, and let the one come into your life who is ready to accept you just the way you are.
Moreover being true about your character will make sure that you never have to fake your emotions.
Faking is something that causes a lot of mental pain, so avoid it as much as you can.

## Money is everything
Money isn’t everything, but everything needs money. Who said the money couldn’t buy happiness?(this is said by only those who have a lot of money) Well, it can. When you have money in your pocket, you are good enough to get anything and everything you desire.
Of course, there are certain things in life which can’t be bought with money, but we aren’t going to list them here.

## People look for “Kindness” not for “kinds.” Invest in kindness, not in kinds.
Kindness is what the world expects from you. If you gift someone a cell phone today, they will forget about it after a couple of months, but, if you help someone in need, they are not going to forget about it for a long time.
The choice is yours, either invest in kindness or kinds.
However, make sure that you invest in either one or the other.

## Everyone is a bit selfish
Some people might act as if they are selfless, but do remember that nothing is the same as it looks from its outside.
It is a fact that those *SELFLESS* people are the most selfish when it comes to something that’s related to them.
Moreover, it will be dumb to consider anyone as selfless in this 21st century. No one is a saint here!

### Guys I know some of you won't agree with my views but the reason is for that is you didn't saw the reality. And yes I respect your views you can learn all this in future when you face the harsh life by yourself.
